 * Created by Adam Cantor on 7/1/2015.
 * This file is intended to generate a single agent and to add it to the swarm where they will move randomly given
 * the random initialized HoneyAgent variables and simulation parameters. These can be added to ad infinitum in this file
 *
 * The simplest individual HoneyAgent vehicle has 2 initial variables: Destination, and Time Intent
 * A single HoneyAgent also records the following situational data (stored by server): Time to Park, and Time Spent in Spot
